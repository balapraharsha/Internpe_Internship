# 🧠 Internpe Internship Projects

Welcome to my internship project repository under **InternPe**! This collection showcases the hands-on projects I built while exploring real-world applications of Machine Learning and Data Science.

Each folder in this repository contains a standalone project with code, dataset, and explanation. Projects demonstrate my learning and application of various ML concepts, and each one includes a prediction system trained on real data.
