# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is developed during my internship at **InternPe**. It is a machine learning-based system that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in a patient using health metrics 

## 📌 Project Overview

An interactive and educational end-to-end ML pipeline that includes:
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training using **Logistic Regression**
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
- CLI-based user input system for real-time diabetes prediction

## 📊 Dataset

- **Features**: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age
- **Target**: Outcome (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Not Diabetic)

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Import Libraries**
2. **Load Dataset**
3. **Preprocess Data** (handle missing values, scale features)
4. **Train Logistic Regression model**
5. **Evaluate the model**
6. **Predict from User Input (CLI)**

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy: ~75%
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1 Score

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- StandardScaler
- LogisticRegression

## 💡 Insight

One instance was predicted as "not diabetic" but was actually "diabetic" — highlighting the importance of model evaluation in healthcare contexts.
